## Exploring Adolescent Self-Regulation Across Three Continents
Dr. Brandon Kohrt and Dr. Georgia Eleftheriou recently participated in the 4th Annual Meeting of the ALIVE Project in Kathmandu, Nepal, where they presented new developments in adapting neuropsychological tasks for adolescents in Kathmandu (Nepal), Bogotá (Colombia), and Cape Town (South Africa).

The Emotional Go/No-Go (EGNG), Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), and Delay Discounting Task (DDT), are powerful tools for studying self-regulation, particularly in youth affected by anxiety and depression. Self-regulation encompasses risk-taking, impulsivity, and emotional control, critical areas for understanding mental health during adolescence.

### The Emotional Go/No-Go Task

The Emotional Go/No-Go Task measures how well someone can inhibit reactions to emotionally charged cues, shedding light on how emotional and cognitive processes interact. Research shows that adolescents, especially those exposed to early adversity, often struggle with emotional inhibition, linked to ongoing brain development and heightened amygdala responses.

### The Delay Discounting Task

The Delay Discounting Task looks at our ability to delay gratification, choosing a larger reward later rather than a smaller one now. Adolescents with anxiety or depression often show steeper discounting, meaning they find it harder to wait, a pattern connected to impulsivity and emotional dysregulation.

### The Baloon Analogue Risk Task

And in the Balloon Analogue Risk Task, patterns of risk-taking emerge adolescents with anxiety tend to be overly cautious, while those with depression may take more risks, possibly due to reduced sensitivity to potential negative outcomes.

These findings highlight how anxiety and depression can lead to very different self-regulatory profiles over-control in anxiety and under-control in depression. By adapting and applying these tasks across diverse global settings, the ALIVE project aims to better understand these dynamics and support culturally relevant mental health interventions for youth.

Below is an example of how the Delay Discounting Task was adapted for adolescents across the three countries Nepal South Africa and Colombia.

This figure illustrates how the Delay Discounting Task was adapted for adolescents in Kathmandu (Nepal), Bogotá (Colombia), and Cape Town (South Africa). Each version reflects local language, culturally relevant rewards, and context-specific scenarios, ensuring that the task remains engaging and meaningful while preserving its ability to measure impulsivity and delayed gratification. These adaptations will help researchers to better understand how self-regulation manifests in diverse settings, particularly among youth with anxiety and depression.
